## Description

Proffy study platform is Rocketseat's project for the Next Level Week (NLW) program, created using React Native framework.

In this mobile interface, students can search for classes by filtering for a subject and a schedule. Then, users can contact a professor through whatsapp or favorite them to view later.

If a professor wants to create a class, they must go to the web interface, as this mobile app has reduced functionalities.


## Setup

To launch the mobile app, we used Expo's toolkit. So after initializating the app, the user must either use a phone simulator or a real phone to run the application.

```
  yarn install
  yarn start
```
